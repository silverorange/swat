<p><strong>We&#8217;ve been using free and
<a href="http://labs.silverorange.com/archives/2005/june/freeandopen">open-source
software at silverorange</a> for years now.</strong> In the last year, though,
we&#8217;ve begun releasing more of our internal web-development software stack
under an open-source license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While our <a href="https://code.silverorange.com/wiki/Swat">Swat web
application toolkit</a> (it&#8217;s <em>not a framework</em>) has been open
since it&#8217;s inception, it has been missing some of the key infrastructure
required for a healthy open-source project. The code was available, that was
about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, with the new
<a href="http://code.silverorange.com/">code.silverorange.com</a> website
(based on <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> - a past nominee for
silverorange <a href="http://labs.silverorange.com/archives/2008/january/employee2007">employee
of the year</a>), we finally have the rest of the public project infrastructure
in place.</p>

<p>Most importantly among these changes, we finally have a public bug-tracking
system! This took longer than expected because we had Swat bug-tracking tied in
with our internal (private client) project tracking. The two are finally
separated, and everything that should be open is now out in the open.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re are also now in a position to grant SVN commit access to external
contributors when appropriate.</p>

<p>The silverorange code site isn&#8217;t limited to Swat either. We have a
whole set of packages we use for developing client sites, including a
<a href="http://code.silverorange.com/wiki/Admin">back-end website
administration package</a>, an
<a href="http://code.silverorange.com/wiki/Store">e-commerce package</a>, a
<a href="http://code.silverorange.com/wiki/Pinhole">photo-gallery package</a>,
and a (fledgling) <a href="http://code.silverorange.com/wiki/Blorg">weblog
package</a>. Each of these projects now has a section of it&#8217;s own on the
code.silverorange.com site, and they share a
<a href="https://code.silverorange.com/wiki/Swat/GetInvolved">mailing list and
Jabber chat room</a> with Swat.</p>

<p>For those who have been patient enough to follow and participate in our
open-source projects so far, we&#8217;re appreciative. We hope to be much more
open to external collaboration and contributions with this new
infrastructure.</p>
