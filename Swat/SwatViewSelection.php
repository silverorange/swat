/**
 * A selection on a view
 *
 * Selections are iteratable and countable. A usual pattern for working with
 * selections is to use it in a <code>foreach</code> statement as follows:
 *
 * <code>
 * foreach ($view->getSelection() as $id) {
 *     // perform an action with the id
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * There can be multiple selections on a single view because each view can have
 * multiple selectors.
 *
 * Selections usually include only row ids, not rows themselves. Though this
 * may seem less useful, it is done because the selection may be used after
 * the view processed but before the view is displayed. Often the view data
 * is only created when the view is displayed. If the processing of a view
 * means the view does not need to be displayed this can remove the need for
 * unnecessary queries.
