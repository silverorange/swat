Swat

This is a change to be detected
Swat is a web application component toolkit.

Swat is an open-source
[LGPL 2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt)
web-application toolkit built using [PHP](https://www.php.net/). It is primarily
developed and maintained by [silverorange](https://www.silverorange.com), but
participation and contributions are welcome.

Swat is *not* a full-stack web framework. Swat is an interface toolkit
analogous to [Gtk](https://gtk.org/ Gtk), but for web applications instead of
native applications. Read about
[why Swat was created](https://github.com/silverorange/swat/wiki/History).
